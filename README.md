# 3DPrinting
Umbrella repo for all 3d related self-projects. This will serve as a master folder for all solo 3DPrinting/Engineering related projects.

# Projects
## Hanging Headphones
Finished. Tiny starter project to start learning FreeCAD and take a stab at printing my first custom designed print.

## XboxOneControllerHanger
Finished. Second FreeCad project. A little more advanced, not entirely complex. A underside desk hanger for my XboxOne controller.

## PartialProsthetic

Ongoing. Personal project. Designing a partial hand prosthetic for myself, which will include at most essential form: a palm cover, string/tendon mechanism, and two fingers for ring and pinky to help with daily activities. Have a few design ideas.., slow project.
